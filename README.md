# Gaoussou's Accounting Ledger Application
A Java Command Line Interface (CLI) application to track all financial transactions for businesses or personal use. Transactions are saved in a `transactions.csv` file.

## Project Planning
The initial phase for launching this app involved leveraging GitHubâ€™s built-in project management tools. I began by mapping out every task on a Kanban board, assigning each task to myself and creating a dedicated branch for each one. As soon as I started working on a task, I updated its status to "In Progress." Once a task was completed, merged, and pulled to GitHub, it automatically moved to the "Done" column, and the changes were pushed to my accounting-ledger-app repository using Git Bash.


- Created Tasks, Assigned them to myself, Created Branches, Added a Project Status Tracker, Project Description

- Added a description to each task and a user story

- Tasks get displayed on the board based on their status

- Using Git Bash in the terminal to fetch, checkout, add&commit, push, merge and pull

When planning to make my project user-friendly, I focused a lot on its overall structure. As the screenshot shows, my application is now organized into four main classes:
- AccountingLedgerApp: This class serves as the entry point, housing the main method and coordinating the various screens of the app.
- CSVHandler: This class is responsible for managing all CSV file operations, ensuring efficient data input and output (Reading/Writing). 
- Screens: All the code responsible for rendering and managing the different user interface screens is contained here.
- Transaction: This class constructs and manages individual transaction objects, encapsulating all the related data.

This modular design not only simplifies maintenance and future enhancements but also ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience.

## Highlighted Code:

I chose this block of code as my highlighted code due to its effiicient improvement for a Readable Output. By specifying fixed-width fields (%-12s, %-8s, etc.), the code ensures that, regardless of the varying length of each data field, the final output is presented in a clean, tabular format. This attention to detail greatly improves the user experience in a command-line interface.
