## Project Planning

The initial phase for launching this app involved leveraging GitHubâ€™s built-in project management tools. I began by mapping out every task on a Kanban board, assigning each task to myself and creating a dedicated branch for each one. As soon as I started working on a task, I updated its status to "In Progress." Once a task was completed, merged, and pulled to GitHub, it automatically moved to the "Done" column, and the changes were pushed to my accounting-ledger-app repository using Git Bash.
